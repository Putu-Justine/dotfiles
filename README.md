# What's this?
This is my personal config files for i3-gaps. Based on EvanKoe & rxyhn dotfiles.
# Purpose of this rice
I actually used rxyhn dots before, and i like it. but his awesome modules spawned on the second monitor if i plug a second monitor to my laptop and got annoyed by it. After some researching, i3 does not do this and used EvanKoe dots on it (2022 one). But my head went "Frick it. Combine both of them." And this dots born.

# Post Install
On the first login, polybar and i3 will load successfuly, but nitrogen does not. 

To fix it, Open Nitrogen (via Super+D, from rofi) and click preferences. Add directory for wallpapers (on my setup i put it on ```/usr/share/pixmaps```) and click OK. Select the wallpapers and click apply.

For GTK themes, open lxappearance, under "Widget", select ```Materia-moredark-compact```, for fonts select ```Noto Sans CJK JP Regular```, under "Icon theme" select ```Papirus Dark```, under "Mouse cursor" select ```Volantes Cursors```.

For Qt themes, (i assumed you installed qt5-styleplugins) open ```/etc/environment``` using your favourite text editor and put this lines on the bottom of the text : ```QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk2```

For notifications, run ```xfce4-notifyd-config``` from rofi, and change default position to bottom right.

For LightDM, open/create ```/etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf``` with your favourite text editor, remove all stuff inside the file, and paste with this new config :
```
[greeter]
theme-name = Materia-moredark-compact
icon-theme-name = Papirus-Dark
font-name = Noto Sans CJK JP Medium 11
xft-rgba = rgb
xft-hintstyle = hintfull
indicators =
background = /usr/share/pixmaps/main.png
```
Save it and reboot.
