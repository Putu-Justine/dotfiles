# What's this?
This is my personal config files for i3-gaps. Based on EvanKoe & rxyhn dotfiles.
# Purpose of this rice
I actually used rxyhn dots before, and i like it. but his awesome modules spawned on the second monitor if i plug a second monitor to my laptop and got annoyed by it. After some researching, i3 does not do this and used EvanKoe dots on it (2022 one). But my head went "Frick it. Combine both of them." And this dots born.
